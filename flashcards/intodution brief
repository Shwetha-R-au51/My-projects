 First off what a great looking application. It can both help students study and keep them from spending money on paper flashcards.
  This is the first project on the list where we used flexbox so it was little challenging at first. Once I got the hang of it, however, 
  it was actually very easy to use and it made the project a lot more dynamic.
  In particular,I really enjoyed the align-item, flex-wrap,
  and justify-content options because they made the flashcards responsive.
